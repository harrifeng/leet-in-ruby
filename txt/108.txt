108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
Difficulty: Medium
Contributors: Admin
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a
height balanced BST.

Note:
An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:
1) Left subtree of T is balanced
2) Right subtree of T is balanced
3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1
