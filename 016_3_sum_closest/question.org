* 016 3Sum Closest
  + Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum
    is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers.
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
  + For example, given array
    #+begin_example
      S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
    #+end_example
  + The sum that is closest to the target is
    #+begin_example
      2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
    #+end_example
